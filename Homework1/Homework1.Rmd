# Linear Regression

Linear regression analysis is conducted on airquality data.

## Code

Code for linear regression is as following.

First code inputs the airquality data.
```{r inputdata}
library(datasets)
Ozone = airquality$Ozone
Wind = airquality$Wind
```

Second code conducts a linear regression analysis; the regression model is as following:
  Ozone ~ Wind
```{r linreg}
fit <- lm(Ozone~Wind)
fit
```

## Including Plots

Here are plots for the linear regression model.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(fit)
```
